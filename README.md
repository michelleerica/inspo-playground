## Front-end / back-end playground

I wanted to play around with different front-end and back-end frameworks, so I've created a super simple inspirational quote website (with CRUD).

Currently, I'm using Rails as the API and React.js on the front end but once the basical functionality is in place, I'm going to build the front end all again in Vue.js ... and then maybe Angular. I want to compare and contrast different frameworks, all of which are relatively new to me.

The plan:
- Rails (in progress)
- React (in progress)
- Vue
- Firebase
- ...
